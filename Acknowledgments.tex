First and foremost, I would like to express my dearest gratitude to both my supervisors Christos and Tom. Thank you for giving me the chance to come work with you at King's College in London, in this vibrant environment. It has been a once in a lifetime opportunity for me to come here. It has not always been the straightest route. We worked through COVID together, you kept the spirits up, despite your hardship of working extra hours on schooling your children. You were forgiving when things went the wrong way, and encouraged me to keep pushing. Thank you for being available day and night, during holidays and weekends, for proof-reading every paper, for taking the time to meet regularly, for hinting me in the right direction and listening to stupid ideas, thank you for creating opportunities, letting me go to places, and exposing me to all your network. I cannot thank you enough. I hope this is just the start and that we can continue on this journey together.

I am deeply thankful for meeting Konrad, for him giving me the opportunity to work in the US during an internship. Thank you for all your hard work, your mentorship, and for making me feel at home. I would further like to thank his team for their continued help on-site, for playing volleyball together, going to hikes, and many more occasions: Eva (Yuqing), Olivier, Bryan, Ahmed, Alisha, Alan.
