First and foremost, I would like to express my dearest gratitude to both my supervisors Christos and Tom. Thank you for giving me the chance to come work with you at King's College in London, in this vibrant environment. It has been a once in a lifetime opportunity to come here. It has not always been the straightest route. We worked through COVID together, you kept the spirits up, despite your hardship of working extra hours and schooling your children. You were forgiving when things went the wrong way, and encouraged me to keep pushing. Thank you for being available day and night, during holidays and weekends, for proof-reading every paper, for taking the time to meet regularly, for hinting me in the right direction and listening to stupid ideas, thank you for creating opportunities, letting me go to places, and exposing me to all your network. I cannot thank you enough. Without your brilliance, dedication, and support, this thesis would not exist. I hope this is just the start and that we can continue on this journey together.

Next, I would like to thank the thesis progression commitee (TPC): Adelaide, Kawal, Hongbin, Prashant.  Your feedback helped shape the research targets immensely. I would like to express a special thanks to Adelaide, the TPC chair, for always being available and responding to requests promptly.

Thank you to the KCL staff, for keeping things running. I would especially like to thank the IT team for supporting the GPU cluster and providing the bouncer server: Andrew and Davide. Thank you also to Laurence for always helping with purchase orders swiftly. I would further like to thank David for getting the laboratories up and running promptly during COVID, and for helpful discussions. My gratitude further goes to the SIE managers: Carlo, Marty, Duane, and Gayathri. Thank you for always helping with printing, moving, custom building screws and metal blocks, and for finding equipment. Without you, none of the experiments would have been possible. I would further like to thank the security personell and the cleaning lady. Thank you for letting me into Becket House and the SIE laboratories day and night. Thank you further for keeping my desk in an orderly state.

I am deeply thankful for meeting Konrad, for him giving me the opportunity to work in the US during an internship. Thank you for all your hard work, your mentorship, and for making me feel at home. Some of the learnings are now ingrained in this work, too. I would further like to thank his team for their continued help on-site, for playing volleyball together, going to hikes, and many more occasions: Eva (Yuqing), Olivier, Bryan, Ahmed, Alisha, Alan.

%FAROS
I am very thankful for the collaborations with the entire FAROS team. Pulling a project of this scale off has not always been easy and required heavy lifting work from many participants. Thank you to the team from Leuven: Manu, Ayoob, Maikel, Ruixuan, and Kaat, for their input and support, especially for letting us use their robot. Thank you to the team from Zurich: Philipp, Fabio, Frederic, Nicola, and Aidana. A special thanks to Fabio, for having me stay on his couch during one of the integration weeks and for being a good friend. Thank you also to Frederic, for the joint work on robot drivers. Thank you to the team from Paris: Guillaume, Antoine, Jimmy, Francois, Saman, Lilian, Thibault, and Ellie. Many of the experiments that contributed to this thesis would not have been possible without your work.

Weitherhin möchte ich meinen ehemaligen Mitstudenten und Freunden aus Heidelberg danken. Danke Lucas und Lucas, unser ständiger Ideenaustaucht, insbesondere durch unseren Journal Club während COVID, aber auch im Allgemeinen, hat einige Einsichten dieser Arbeit geprägt. Danke auch dafür, gute Freunde zu sein. Dein Besuch in London zu Beginn der Arbeit, Lucas, war ein echt schönes Erlebnis und er hat mir sehr dabei geholfen meinen Weg zu finden. Danke auch an Markus und dafür, dass ich bei dir zu Ende der Masterarbeit wohnen durfte, was das alles irgendwie in Gang gebracht hat. Danke auch an deine Oma.

Zu guter Letzt möchte ich dem Team der International Feedaz für ihren anhaltenden Hype danken, der die ein oder andere dunkle Nacht erleuchtet hat. In alphabetischer Reihenfolge: Dennis, Hendrik, Lukas und Viktor.
