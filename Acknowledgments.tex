First and foremost, I would like to express my dearest gratitude to both my supervisors Christos and Tom. Thank you for giving me the chance to come work with you at King's College in London, in this vibrant environment. It has been a once in a lifetime opportunity to come here. It has not always been the straightest route. We worked through COVID together, you kept the spirits up, despite your hardship of working extra hours and schooling your children. You were forgiving when things went the wrong way, and encouraged me to keep pushing. Thank you for being available day and night, during holidays and weekends, for proof-reading every paper, for taking the time to meet regularly, for hinting me in the right direction and listening to stupid ideas, thank you for creating opportunities, letting me go to places, and exposing me to all your network. I cannot thank you enough. Without your brilliance, dedication, and support, this thesis would not exist. I hope this is just the start and that we can continue on this journey together.

Next, I would like to thank the thesis progression commitee (TPC): Adelaide, Kawal, Hongbin, Prashant.  Your feedback helped shape the research targets immensely. I would like to express a special thanks to Adelaide, the TPC chair, for always being available and responding to requests promptly.

I am deeply thankful for meeting Konrad, for him giving me the opportunity to work in the US during an internship. Thank you for all your hard work, your mentorship, and for making me feel at home. Some of the learnings are now ingrained in this work, too. I would further like to thank his team for their continued help on-site, for playing volleyball together, going to hikes, and many more occasions: Eva (Yuqing), Olivier, Bryan, Ahmed, Alisha, Alan.

%FAROS
I am very thankful for the collaborations with the entire FAROS team. Pulling a project of this scale off has not always been easy and required heavy lifting work from many participants. Thank you to the team from Leuven: Manu, Ayoob, Maikel, Ruixuan, and Kaat, for their input and support, especially for letting us use their robot. Thank you to the team from Zurich: Philipp, Fabio, Frederic, Nicola, and Aidana. A special thanks to Fabio, for having me stay on his couch during one of the integration weeks and for being a good friend. Thank you also to Frederic, for the joint work on robot drivers. Thank you to the team from Paris: Guillaume, Antoine, Jimmy, Francois, Saman, Lilian, Thibault, and Ellie. Many of the experiments that contributed to this thesis would not have been possible without your work.
