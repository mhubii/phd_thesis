- differentiable rendering -> solving draped robots

- QP or other solvers

- inpainting -> better range
- rl on-top (force controlled rcm, rlhf)

- bootstrapping motion:
    - visual qa
- llm interface models

My thesis showed I did very useful things and also pleases my supervisor~\cite{Ourselin:MICCAI:00}. I also showed that I somewhat address the challenges laid out in \chapref{chap:intro}.
