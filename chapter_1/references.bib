The method captures the inner structure of complex engineering objects from measured datasets. In the developed workflow first the point cloud is segmented, and then the CAD models of the objects in the work cell are recognized and fitted onto the segmented point cloud. To boost the computational efficiency of the method, parallelization was performed by applying general-purpose programming of the graphics processing unit. In this paper the calibration of a UR5 robot is carried out using measured data of a Kinect sensor.}

  abstract = {Dual-arm space robot is a promising autonomous system to remove the increasing space debris actively. Due to its limited on-orbit energy, dual-arm space robot should approach and capture the target with minimum time and base disturbance. In this paper, the multi-objective configuration optimization is proposed for maximizing manipulability and minimizing base disturbance of dual-arm space robot during the pre-contact phase. Based on virtual base modelling and coordinated planning, the free-floating dual-arm space robots can be controlled to track and approach the target satellite. In addition, in the null-space of tracking motion, the configuration optimization of dual-arm space robot can be realized by arm-angle adjustment of 7 DOF redundant manipulator. Therefore, the expressions of arm angle and arm-angle Jacobian are first derived. Then the arm-angle trajectory is parameterized by adopting 5th order polynomial interpolation. The optimal arm-angle trajectory can be obtained by Multiple Objective Particle Swarm Optimization (MOPSO), in which the objective function of configuration optimization is set to the vector consisted of base disturbance and manipulability. Therefore, in the null space of dual-arm space robot approaching the tumbling target satellite, the configuration optimization is realized through following the optimal arm-angle trajectory. Finally, several single-objective and multi-objective optimization simulations are carried out to verify the proposed method.}

The adoption of the human arm as a model of manoeuvrability, scale and dexterity is the starting point for operation of two seven-function arms within the context of nuclear decommissioning tasks, the selection of hardware and its integration, and the development of suitable control methods. The forward and inverse kinematics for the manipulators are derived and the proposed software architecture identified to control the movements of the arm joints and the performance of selected decommissioning tasks. We discuss the adoption of a BROKK demolition machine as a mobile platform and the integration with its hydraulic system to operate the two seven-function manipulators separately. The paper examines the modelling and development of a real-time control method using Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) and Proportional-Integral-Plus (PIP) control algorithms in the host computer with National Instruments functions and tools to control the manipulators and obtain feedback through wireless communication. Finally we consider the application of a third party device, such as a personal mobile phone, and its interface with LabVIEW software in order to operate the robot arms remotely. }
