Automation is rapidly propagating into our daily lives. Most notably, autonomous vehicles, but also vacuum cleaners, drones, and industrial arms are reaching high levels of autonomy. Many of these advances were made possible through massively increased parallel compute, and consequentially neural networks. In surgery and robotic surgery, however, automation advances lack somewhat behind related domains. In addition to the unstructured environment, as well as regulatory and ethic hurdles, in this thesis we argue that also technical aspects hinder further development. As the title suggests, and due to its relative simplicity, robotic endoscope camera motion automation is of immediate relevance to this work. The technical hurdles hurdles therein are twofold.
